- automatic accepted if submissions are not decided on after beginning of settled period
- send funds to workers when going settled
- if we are past the window of a certain phase but still havent gone to the next phase we should be able to push everything by however much time we are late
- if owner doesn't move to settled, nothing can happen
- solve the issue of what happens if we don't go to stage because we dont have any workers and that's the case for a long time
